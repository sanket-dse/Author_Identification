"The father, with a curse and a wave of the hand, ran out into the yard.",AC,dummy
"But on this occasion, unfortunately, Pyotr the student was carried away by overmastering anger.",AC,dummy
"He was just as hasty and ill-tempered as his father and his grandfather the priest, who used to beat his parishioners about the head with a stick.",AC,dummy
"Pale and clenching his fists, he went up to his mother and shouted in the very highest tenor note his voice could reach:  ""These reproaches are loathsome!",AC,dummy
"The mother huddled against the wall and waved her hands, as though it were not her son, but some phantom before her.",AC,dummy

"On one side the house looked towards the ravine, on the other towards the open country, there were no fences nor hurdles.",AC,dummy
"Instead there were farm-buildings of all sorts close to one another, shutting in a small space in front of the house which was regarded as the yard, and in which hens, ducks, and pigs ran about.",AC,dummy
"Going out of the house, the student walked along the muddy road towards the open country.",AC,dummy
"The road was muddy, puddles gleamed here and there, and in the yellow fields autumn itself seemed looking out from the grass, dismal, decaying, dark.",AC,dummy
"On the right-hand side of the road was a vegetable-garden cleared of its crops and gloomy-looking, with here and there sunflowers standing up in it with hanging heads already black.",AC,dummy
"Pyotr thought it would not be a bad thing to walk to Moscow on foot; to walk just as he was, with holes in his boots, without a cap, and without a farthing of money.",AC,dummy
"When he had gone eighty miles his father, frightened and aghast, would overtake him, would begin begging him to turn back or take the money, but he would not even look at him, but would go on and on.... Bare forests would be followed by desolate fields, fields by forests again; soon the earth would be white with the first snow, and the streams would be coated with ice.... Somewhere near Kursk or near Serpuhovo, exhausted and dying of hunger, he would sink down and die.",AC,dummy
"His corpse would be found, and there would be a paragraph in all the papers saying that a student called Shiryaev had died of hunger....  A white dog with a muddy tail who was wandering about the vegetable-garden looking for something gazed at him and sauntered after him.",AC,dummy
"He walked along the road and thought of death, of the grief of his family, of the moral sufferings of his father, and then pictured all sorts of adventures on the road, each more marvellous than the one before—picturesque places, terrible nights, chance encounters.",AC,dummy
"He imagined a string of pilgrims, a hut in the forest with one little window shining in the darkness; he stands before the window, begs for a night's lodging....",AC,dummy
"They let him in, and suddenly he sees that they are robbers.",AC,dummy
"Or, better still, he is taken into a big manor-house, where, learning who he is, they give him food and drink, play to him on the piano, listen to his complaints, and the daughter of the house, a beauty, falls in love with him.",AC,dummy
"Absorbed in his bitterness and such thoughts, young Shiryaev walked on and on.",AC,dummy
"Far, far ahead he saw the inn, a dark patch against the grey background of cloud.",AC,dummy
"Beyond the inn, on the very horizon, he could see a little hillock; this was the railway-station.",AC,dummy
"That hillock reminded him of the connection existing between the place where he was now standing and Moscow, where street-lamps were burning and carriages were rattling in the streets, where lectures were being given.",AC,dummy
"The solemn landscape, with its order and beauty, the deathlike stillness all around, revolted him and moved him to despair and hatred!",AC,dummy
"An old lady of his acquaintance, a landowner of the neighbourhood, drove past him in a light, elegant landau.",AC,dummy
"He bowed to her, and smiled all over his face.",AC,dummy
"And at once he caught himself in that smile, which was so out of keeping with his gloomy mood.",AC,dummy
"And he thought nature itself had given man this capacity for lying, that even in difficult moments of spiritual strain he might be able to hide the secrets of his nest as the fox and the wild duck do.",AC,dummy
"Every family has its joys and its horrors, but however great they may be, it's hard for an outsider's eye to see them; they are a secret.",AC,dummy
"The father of the old lady who had just driven by, for instance, had for some offence lain for half his lifetime under the ban of the wrath of Tsar Nicolas I.; her husband had been a gambler; of her four sons, not one had turned out well.",AC,dummy
"One could imagine how many terrible scenes there must have been in her life, how many tears must have been shed.",AC,dummy
"And yet the old lady seemed happy and satisfied, and she had answered his smile by smiling too.",AC,dummy
"The student thought of his comrades, who did not like talking about their families; he thought of his mother, who almost always lied when she had to speak of her husband and children....  Pyotr walked about the roads far from home till dusk, abandoning himself to dreary thoughts.",AC,dummy
"As he walked back he made up his mind at all costs to talk to his father, to explain to him, once and for all, that it was dreadful and oppressive to live with him.",AC,dummy
"His sister Varvara was lying behind a screen with a headache, moaning faintly.",AC,dummy
"His mother, with a look of amazement and guilt upon her face, was sitting beside her on a box, mending Arhipka's trousers.",AC,dummy
"Yevgraf Ivanovitch was pacing from one window to another, scowling at the weather.",AC,dummy
"From his walk, from the way he cleared his throat, and even from the back of his head, it was evident he felt himself to blame.",AC,dummy
"The student felt sorry for him, but immediately suppressing that feeling, he said:  ""Listen...",AC,dummy
"I must speak to you seriously... yes, seriously.",AC,dummy
"I have always respected you, and... and have never brought myself to speak to you in such a tone, but your behaviour... your last action...""  The father looked out of the window and did not speak.",AC,dummy
"The student, as though considering his words, rubbed his forehead and went on in great excitement:  ""Not a dinner or tea passes without your making an uproar.",AC,dummy
"Your bread sticks in our throat... nothing is more bitter, more humiliating, than bread that sticks in one's throat....",AC,dummy
"Though you are my father, no one, neither God nor nature, has given you the right to insult and humiliate us so horribly, to vent your ill-humour on the weak.",AC,dummy
"You have worn my mother out and made a slave of her, my sister is hopelessly crushed, while I...""  ""It's not your business to teach me,"" said his father.",AC,dummy
"""Yes, it is my business!",AC,dummy
"You can quarrel with me as much as you like, but leave my mother in peace!",AC,dummy
"the student went on, with flashing eyes.",AC,dummy
"They tremble and are mute towards you, but now that is over!",AC,dummy
"Coarse, ill-bred man!",AC,dummy
"You are coarse, ill-humoured, unfeeling.",AC,dummy
"The student had by now lost his thread, and was not so much speaking as firing off detached words.",AC,dummy
"Yevgraf Ivanovitch listened in silence, as though stunned; but suddenly his neck turned crimson, the colour crept up his face, and he made a movement.",AC,dummy
"""Hold your tongue, I tell you!""",AC,dummy
"Fedosya Semyonovna appeared in the doorway, very pale, with an astonished face; she tried to say something, but she could not, and could only move her fingers.",AC,dummy
"shouted the student, crying, and looking angrily at his mother.",AC,dummy
"With a wave of his hand, Shiryaev ran out of the house.",AC,dummy
"He felt neither anger nor shame, but a vague ache in his soul.",AC,dummy
"He neither blamed his father nor pitied his mother, nor was he tormented by stings of conscience; he realized that every one in the house was feeling the same ache, and God only knew which was most to blame, which was suffering most....  At midnight he woke the labourer, and told him to have the horse ready at five o'clock in the morning for him to drive to the station; he undressed and got into bed, but could not get to sleep.",AC,dummy
"He heard how his father, still awake, paced slowly from window to window, sighing, till early morning.",AC,dummy
"No one was asleep; they spoke rarely, and only in whispers.",AC,dummy
"Always with the same look of vacant wonder, she slowly made the cross over him, shaking nervously.",AC,dummy
"At five o'clock in the morning he said good-bye to them all affectionately, and even shed tears.",AC,dummy
"As he passed his father's room, he glanced in at the door.",AC,dummy
"Yevgraf Ivanovitch, who had not taken off his clothes or gone to bed, was standing by the window, drumming on the panes.",AC,dummy
"""Good-bye; I am going,"" said his son.",AC,dummy
"""Good-bye... the money is on the round table..."" his father answered, without turning round.",AC,dummy
"A cold, hateful rain was falling as the labourer drove him to the station.",AC,dummy
"The sunflowers were drooping their heads still lower, and the grass seemed darker than ever.",AC,dummy
"The sexton, Savely Gykin, was lying in his huge bed in the hut adjoining the church.",AC,dummy
"He was not asleep, though it was his habit to go to sleep at the same time as the hens.",AC,dummy
"His coarse red hair peeped from under one end of the greasy patchwork quilt, made up of coloured rags, while his big unwashed feet stuck out from the other.",AC,dummy
"It was hard to say who was being wiped off the face of the earth, and for the sake of whose destruction nature was being churned up into such a ferment; but, judging from the unceasing malignant roar, someone was getting it very hot.",AC,dummy
"A victorious force was in full chase over the fields, storming in the forest and on the church roof, battering spitefully with its fists upon the windows, raging and tearing, while something vanquished was howling and wailing.... A plaintive lament sobbed at the window, on the roof, or in the stove.",AC,dummy
"It sounded not like a call for help, but like a cry of misery, a consciousness that it was too late, that there was no salvation.",AC,dummy
"In short, it was thawing, but through the dark night the heavens failed to see it, and flung flakes of fresh snow upon the melting earth at a terrific rate.",AC,dummy
"It would not let the snow settle on the ground, and whirled it round in the darkness at random.",AC,dummy
"The fact was that he knew, or at any rate suspected, what all this racket outside the window was tending to and whose handiwork it was.",AC,dummy
"he muttered, shaking his finger menacingly under the bedclothes; ""I know all about it.""",AC,dummy
"On a stool by the window sat the sexton's wife, Raissa Nilovna.",AC,dummy
"A tin lamp standing on another stool, as though timid and distrustful of its powers, shed a dim and flickering light on her broad shoulders, on the handsome, tempting-looking contours of her person, and on her thick plait, which reached to the floor.",AC,dummy
"Her hands moved nimbly, while her whole body, her eyes, her eyebrows, her full lips, her white neck were as still as though they were asleep, absorbed in the monotonous, mechanical toil.",AC,dummy
"Only from time to time she raised her head to rest her weary neck, glanced for a moment towards the window, beyond which the snowstorm was raging, and bent again over her sacking.",AC,dummy
"No desire, no joy, no grief, nothing was expressed by her handsome face with its turned-up nose and its dimples.",AC,dummy
"She flung it aside, and, stretching luxuriously, rested her motionless, lack-lustre eyes on the window.",AC,dummy
"The panes were swimming with drops like tears, and white with short-lived snowflakes which fell on the window, glanced at Raissa, and melted....  ""Come to bed!""",AC,dummy
"Savely, all the time watching her expression from under the quilt, put out his head and asked:  ""What is it?""",AC,dummy
"I fancy someone's coming,"" she answered quietly.",AC,dummy
"The sexton flung the quilt off with his arms and legs, knelt up in bed, and looked blankly at his wife.",AC,dummy
"The timid light of the lamp illuminated his hirsute, pock-marked countenance and glided over his rough matted hair.",AC,dummy
"""It's the post,"" muttered Savely, squatting on his heels.",AC,dummy
"In windy weather, when the wind was blowing from the road to the church, the inmates of the hut caught the sound of bells.",AC,dummy
"fancy people wanting to drive about in such weather,"" sighed Raissa.",AC,dummy
"""It has driven by,"" said Savely, getting into bed.",AC,dummy
"The sexton looked anxiously at his wife, leapt out of bed and walked, waddling, to and fro by the stove.",AC,dummy
"The bell went on ringing for a little, then died away again as though it had ceased.",AC,dummy
"""I don't hear it,"" said the sexton, stopping and looking at his wife with his eyes screwed up.",AC,dummy

"""Cross yourself, you fool!""",AC,dummy
"""A witch is a witch,"" Savely pronounced in a hollow, tearful voice, hurriedly blowing his nose on the hem of his shirt; ""though you are my wife, though you are of a clerical family, I'd say what you are even at confession.... Why, God have mercy upon us!",AC,dummy
"Last year on the Eve of the Prophet Daniel and the Three Young Men there was a snowstorm, and what happened then?",AC,dummy

"If he were good-looking, anyway—but he, tfoo!",AC,dummy
"The sexton took breath, wiped his lips and listened.",AC,dummy
"The bell was not to be heard, but the wind banged on the roof, and again there came a tinkle in the darkness.",AC,dummy

"To be more impressive the sexton put his finger to his forehead, closed his left eye, and said in a singsong voice:  ""Oh, the madness!",AC,dummy
"oh, the unclean Judas!",AC,dummy
"If you really are a human being and not a witch, you ought to think what if he is not the mechanic, or the clerk, or the huntsman, but the devil in their form!",AC,dummy

"With its customary discretion, the Company did not reply directly; instead, it scrawled its brief argument in the rubble of a mask factory.",LB,dummy
"It pointed out, doctrinally, that the Lottery is an interpolation of chance into the order of the universe, and observed that to accept errors is to strengthen chance, not contravene it.",LB,dummy

"However unlikely it may seem, no one, until that time, had attempted to produce a general theory of gaming.",LB,dummy
"Babylonians are not a speculative people; they obey the dictates of chance, surrender their lives, their hopes, their nameless terror to it, but it never occurs to them to delve into its labyrinthine laws or the revolving spheres that manifest its workings.",LB,dummy
"Nonetheless, the semiofficial statement that I mentioned inspired numerous debates of a legal and mathematical nature.",LB,dummy
"From one of them, there emerged the following conjecture: If the Lottery is an intensification of chance, a periodic infusion of chaos into the cosmos, then is it not appropriate that chance intervene in every aspect of the drawing, not just one?",LB,dummy
"Is it not ludicrous that chance should dictate a person's death while the circumstances of that death—whether private or public, whether drawn out for an hour or a century—should not be subject to chance?",LB,dummy
"Those perfectly reasonable objections finally prompted sweeping reform; the complexities of the new system (complicated further by its having been in practice for centuries) are understood by only a handful of specialists, though I will attempt to summarize them, even if only symbolically.",LB,dummy
"Let us imagine a first drawing, which condemns a man to death.",LB,dummy
"In pursuance of that decree, another drawing is held; out of that second drawing come, say, nine possible executors.",LB,dummy
"Of those nine, four might initiate a third drawing to determine the name of the executioner, two might replace the unlucky draw with a lucky one (the discovery of a treasure, say), another might decide that the death should be exacerbated (death with dishonor, that is, or with the refinement of torture), others might simply refuse to carry out the sentence----That is the scheme of the Lottery, put symbolically.",LB,dummy

"It is fair to recall that Heliogabalus was raised in Asia Minor, among the priests of his eponymous god.",LB,dummy
"There are also impersonal drawings, whose purpose is unclear.",LB,dummy
"One drawing decrees that a sapphire from Taprobana be thrown into the waters of the Euphrates; another, that a bird be released from the top of a certain tower; another, that every hundred years a grain of sand be added to (or taken from) the countless grains of sand on a certain beach.",LB,dummy
"Sometimes, the consequences are terrible.",LB,dummy
"Under the Company's beneficent influence, our customs are now steeped in chance.",LB,dummy
"The purchaser of a dozen amphorae of Damascene wine will not be surprised if one contains a talisman, or a viper; the scribe who writes out a contract never fails to include some error; I myself, in this hurried statement, have misrepresented some splendor, some atrocity— perhaps, too, some mysterious monotony.... Our historians, the most perspicacious on the planet, have invented a method for correcting chance; it is well known that the outcomes of this method are (in general) trust-worthy— although, of course, they are never divulged without a measure of deception.",LB,dummy

"One scurrilously suggests that the Company ceased to exist hundreds of years ago, and that the sacred disorder of our lives is purely hereditary, traditional; another believes that the Company is eternal, and teaches that it shall endure until the last night, when the last god shall annihilate the earth.",LB,dummy
"Yet another declares that the Company is omnipotent, but affects only small things: the cry of a bird, the shades of rust and dust, the half dreams that come at dawn.",LB,dummy
"Another, whispered by masked heresiarchs, says that the Company has never existed, and never will.",LB,dummy
"Another, no less despicable, argues that it makes no difference whether one affirms or denies the reality of the shadowy corporation, because Babylon is nothing but an infinite game of chance.",LB,dummy
"In London, in early June of the year 1929,  the rare book dealer Joseph Cartaphilus, of Smyrna, offered the princess de Lucinge the six quarto minor volumes (1715-1720) of Pope's Iliad.",LB,dummy
"The princess purchased them; when she took possession of them, she exchanged a few words with the dealer.",LB,dummy
"He was, she says, an emaciated, grimy man with gray eyes and gray beard and singularly vague features.",LB,dummy
"In October, the princess heard from a passenger on the Zeus that Cartaphilus had died at sea while returning to Smyrna, and that he had been buried on the island of Cos.",LB,dummy
"I As I recall, my travails began in a garden in hundred-gated Thebes, in the time of the emperor Diocletian.",LB,dummy
"I had fought (with no glory) in the recent Egyptian wars and was tribune of a legion quartered in Berenice, on the banks of the Red Sea; there, fever and magic consumed many men who magnanimously coveted the steel blade.",LB,dummy
"The Mauritanians were defeated; the lands once occupied by the rebel cities were dedicated in œternitatem to the Plutonian gods; Alexandria, subdued, in vain sought Caesar's mercy; within the year the legions were to report their triumph, but I myself barely glimpsed the face of Mars.",LB,dummy
"That privation grieved me, and was perhaps why I threw myself into the quest, through vagrant and terrible deserts, for the secret City of the Immortals.",LB,dummy
"My travails, I have said, began in a garden in Thebes.",LB,dummy
"All that night I did not sleep, for there was a combat in my heart.",LB,dummy
"A bloody rider was approaching from the east, weak with exhaustion.",LB,dummy
"A few steps from me, he dismounted and in a faint, insatiable voice asked me, in Latin, the name of the river whose waters laved the city's walls.",LB,dummy
"I told him it was the Egypt, fed by the rains.",LB,dummy
"""It is another river that I seek,"" he replied morosely, ""the secret river that purifies men of death.""",LB,dummy
"He told me that the country of his birth was a mountain that lay beyond the Ganges; it was rumored on that mountain, he told me, that if one traveled westward, to the end of the world, one would come to the river whose waters give immortality.",LB,dummy
"He added that on the far shore of that river lay the City of the Immortals, a city rich in bulwarks and amphitheaters and temples.",LB,dummy
"He died before dawn, but I resolved to go in quest of that city and its river.",LB,dummy
"When interrogated by the torturer, some of the Mauritanian prisoners confirmed the traveler's tale: One of them recalled the Elysian plain, far at the ends of the earth, where men's lives are everlasting; another, the peaks from which the  Pactolus flows, upon which men live for a hundred years.",LB,dummy
"In Rome, I spoke with philosophers who felt that to draw out the span of a man's life was to draw out the agony of his dying and multiply the number of his deaths.",LB,dummy
"Flavius, the Getulian proconsul, entrusted two hundred soldiers to me for the venture; I also recruited a number of mercenaries who claimed they knew the roads, and who were the first to desert.",LB,dummy
"We crossed the lands of the Troglodytes, who devour serpents and lack all verbal commerce; the land of the Garamantas, whose women are held in common and whose food is lions; the land of the Augiles, who worship only Tartarus.",LB,dummy
"We ranged the width and breadth of other deserts—deserts of black sand, where the traveler must usurp the hours of the night, for  the fervency of the day is unbearable.",LB,dummy
"From afar I made out the mountain which gives its name to the Ocean; on its slopes grows the euphorbia, an antidote to poisons, and on its peak live the Satyrs, a nation of wild and rustic men given to lasciviousness.",LB,dummy
"That the bosom of those barbaric lands, where the Earth is the mother of monsters, might succor a famous city—such a thing seemed unthinkable to us all.",LB,dummy
"Thus we continued with our march, for to have regressed would have been to dishonor ourselves.",LB,dummy
"Some of the men, those who were most temerarious, slept with their faces exposed to the moon; soon they burned with fever.",LB,dummy
"Then began the desertions; a short time afterward, the mutinies.",LB,dummy
"In that I acted justly, but a centurion warned me that the mutineers (keen to avenge the crucifixion of one of their number) were weaving a plot for my death.",LB,dummy
"I fled the camp with the few soldiers who were loyal to me; in the desert, among whirlwinds of sand and the vast night, we became separated.",LB,dummy
"For several days I wandered without finding water—or one huge day multiplied by the sun, thirst, and the fear of thirst.",LB,dummy
"At dawn, the distance bristled with pyramids and towers.",LB,dummy
"I dreamed, unbearably, of a small and orderly labyrinth at whose center lay a well; my hands could almost touch it, my eyes see it, but so bewildering and entangled were the turns that I knew I would die before I reached it.",LB,dummy
"II When I disentangled myself at last from that nightmare, I found that my hands were bound behind my back and I was lying in an oblong stone niche no bigger than a common grave, scraped into the caustic slope of a mountain.",LB,dummy
"The sides of the cavity were humid, and had been polished as much by time as by human hands.",LB,dummy
"In my chest I felt a painful throbbing, and I burned with thirst.",LB,dummy
"At the foot of the mountain ran a noiseless, impure stream, clogged by sand  and rubble; on the far bank, the patent City of the Immortals shone dazzlingly in the last (or first) rays of the sun.",LB,dummy
"I could see fortifications, arches, frontispieces, and forums; the foundation of it all was a stone plateau.",LB,dummy
"In the sand had been dug shallow holes; from those wretched holes, from the niches, emerged naked men with gray skin and neglected beards.",LB,dummy
"I thought I recognized these men: they belonged to the bestial lineage of the Troglodytes, who infest the shorelines of the Persian Gulf and the grottoes of Ethiopia; I was surprised neither by the fact that they did not speak nor by seeing them devour serpents.",LB,dummy
"I estimated that I was some thirty paces from the sand; I closed my eyes and threw myself down the mountain, my hands bound behind my back.",LB,dummy
"Before I lost myself in sleep and delirium once more, I inexplicably repeated a few words of Greek: Those from Zeleia, wealthy Trojans, who drink the water of dark Aisepos...",LB,dummy
"In pain, unable to return to the shelter of the caverns, naked on the unknown sand, I let the moon and the sun cast lots for my bleak fate.",LB,dummy
"The Troglodytes, childlike in their barbarity, helped me neither survive nor die.",LB,dummy
"One day, with the sharp edge of a flake of rock, I severed my bonds.",LB,dummy
"The next, I stood up and was able to beg or steal—I, Marcus Flaminius Rufus, military tribune of one of the legions of Rome —my first abominated mouthful of serpent's flesh.",LB,dummy
"Out of avidity to see the Immortals, to touch that more than human City, I could hardly sleep.",LB,dummy
"And as though the Troglodytes could divine my goal, they did not sleep, either.",LB,dummy
"At first I presumed they were keeping a watch over me; later, I imagined that my uneasiness had communicated itself to them, as dogs can be infected in that way.",LB,dummy
"For my departure from the barbarous village I chose the most public of times, sunset, when almost all the men emerged from their holes and crevices in the earth and gazed out unseeingly toward the west.",LB,dummy
"I prayed aloud, less to plead for divine favor than to intimidate the tribe with articulate speech.",LB,dummy
"Two or three men followed me confusedly; they were of short stature (like the others of that species), and inspired more revulsion than fear.",LB,dummy
"I had to skirt a number of irregular pits that I took to be ancient quarries; misled by the City's enormous size, I had thought it was much nearer.",LB,dummy
"Toward midnight, I set my foot upon the black shadow—bristling with idolatrous shapes upon the yellow sand—of the City's wall.",LB,dummy
"I closed my eyes and waited, unsleeping, for the dawn.",LB,dummy
"That plateau, with its precipitous  sides, was as difficult to scale as the walls.",LB,dummy
"In vain did my weary feet walk round it; the black foundation revealed not the slightest irregularity, and the invariance of the walls proscribed even a single door.",LB,dummy
"The force of the day drove me to seek refuge in a cavern; toward the rear there was a pit, and out of the pit, out of the gloom below, rose a ladder.",LB,dummy
"I descended the ladder and made my way through a chaos of squalid galleries to a vast, indistinct circular chamber.",LB,dummy
"Nine doors opened into that cellarlike place; eight led to a maze that returned, deceitfully, to the same chamber; the ninth led through another maze to a second circular chamber identical to the first.",LB,dummy
"The silence was hostile, and virtually perfect; aside from a subterranean wind whose cause I never discovered, within those deep webs of stone there was no sound; even the thin streams of iron-colored water that trickled through crevices in the stone were noiseless.",LB,dummy
"Horribly, I grew used to that dubious world; it began to seem incredible that anything could exist save nine-doored cellars and long, forking subterranean corridors.",LB,dummy
"I know not how long I wandered under the earth; I do know that from time to time, in a confused dream of home, I conflated the horrendous village of the barbarians and the city of my birth, among the clusters of grapes.",LB,dummy
"At the end of one corridor, a not unforeseen wall blocked my path— and a distant light fell upon me.",LB,dummy
"I raised my dazzled eyes; above, vertiginously high above, I saw a circle of sky so blue it was almost purple.",LB,dummy
"Weariness made my muscles slack, but I climbed the stairs, only pausing from time to time to sob clumsily with joy.",LB,dummy
"Little by little I began to discern friezes and the capitals of columns, triangular pediments and vaults, confused glories carved in granite and marble.",LB,dummy
"It was surrounded by a single building, of irregular angles and varying heights.",LB,dummy
"More than any other feature of that incredible monument, I was arrested by the great antiquity of its construction.",LB,dummy
"I felt that it had existed before humankind, before the world itself.",LB,dummy
"Cautiously at first, with indifference as time went on, desperately toward the end, I wandered the staircases and inlaid floors of that labyrinthine palace.",LB,dummy
"This palace is the work of the gods, was my first thought.",LB,dummy
"I explored the uninhabited spaces, and I corrected myself: The gods that built this place have died.",LB,dummy
"Then I reflected upon its peculiarities, and told myself: The gods that built this place were mad.",LB,dummy
"I said this, I know,  in a tone of incomprehensible reproof that verged upon remorse—with more intellectual horror than sensory fear.",LB,dummy
"The impression of great antiquity was joined by others: the impression of endlessness, the sensation of oppressiveness and horror, the sensation of complex irrationality.",LB,dummy
"I had made my way through a dark maze, but it was the bright City of the Immortals that terrified and repelled me.",LB,dummy
"A maze is a house built purposely to confuse men; its architecture, prodigal in symmetries, is made to serve that purpose.",LB,dummy
"In the palace that I imperfectly explored, the architecture had no purpose.",LB,dummy
"There were corridors that led nowhere, unreachably high windows, grandly dramatic doors that opened onto monklike cells or empty shafts, incredible upside-down staircases with upside-down treads and balustrades.",LB,dummy
"Other staircases, clinging airily to the side of a monumental wall, petered out after two or three landings, in the high gloom of the cupolas, arriving nowhere.",LB,dummy
"This City, I thought, is so horrific that its mere existence, the mere fact of its having endured — even in the middle of a secret desert— pollutes the past and the future and somehow compromises the stars.",LB,dummy
"So long as this City endures, no one in the world can ever be happy or courageous.",LB,dummy
"I do not want to describe it; a chaos of heterogeneous words, the body of a tiger or a bull pullulating with teeth, organs, and heads monstrously yoked together yet hating each other—those might, perhaps, be approximate images.",LB,dummy
"I cannot recall the stages by which I returned, nor my path through the dusty, humid crypts.",LB,dummy
"That loss of memory, now insurmountable, was perhaps willful; it is possible that the circumstances of my escape were so unpleasant that on some day no less lost to memory I swore to put them out of my mind.",LB,dummy
"III Those who have read the story of my travails attentively will recall that a man of the Troglodyte tribe had followed me, as a dog might have, into the jagged shadow of the walls.",LB,dummy
"When I emerged from the last cellar, I found him at the mouth of the cavern.",LB,dummy
"He was lying in the sand, clumsily drawing and rubbing out a row of symbols that resembled those letters in dreams that one is just on the verge of understanding when they merge and blur.",LB,dummy
"The man would draw them, look at them, and correct them.",LB,dummy
"Then suddenly, as though his game irritated him, he would rub them out with his palm and forearm.",LB,dummy
"He looked up at me, though he seemed not to recognize me.",LB,dummy
"Still, so great was the relief I felt (or so great, so dreadful had my loneliness been) that I actually thought that this primitive Troglodyte looking up at me from the floor of a cave had been waiting for me.",LB,dummy
"The sun warmed the plain; as we began our return to the village, under the first stars of evening, the sand burned our feet.",LB,dummy
"The Troglodyte walked ahead of me; that night I resolved to teach him to recognize, perhaps even to repeat, a few words.",LB,dummy
"Dogs and horses, I reflected, are able to do the first; many birds, like the Caesars' nightingale, can do the second.",LB,dummy
"However scant a man's understanding, it will always be greater than that of unreasoning beasts.",LB,dummy
"The Troglodyte's lowly birth and condition recalled to my memory the image of Argos, the moribund old dog of the Odyssey, so I gave him the name Argos, and tried to teach it to him.",LB,dummy
"Time and time again, I failed.",LB,dummy
"No means I employed, no severity, no obstinacy of mine  availed.",LB,dummy
"Motionless, his eyes dead, he seemed not even to perceive the sounds which I was attempting to imprint upon him.",LB,dummy
"Though but a few paces from me, he seemed immensely distant.",LB,dummy
"Lying in the sand like a small, battered sphinx carved from lava, he allowed the heavens to circle in the sky above him from the first dusky light of morning to the last dusky light of night.",LB,dummy
"I recalled that it is generally believed among the Ethiopians that monkeys deliberately do not speak, so that they will not be forced to work; I attributed Argos' silence to distrust or fear.",LB,dummy
"From that vivid picture I passed on to others, even more extravagant.",LB,dummy
"I reflected that Argos and I lived our lives in separate universes; I reflected that our perceptions were identical but that Argos combined them differently than I, constructed from them different objects; I reflected that perhaps for him there were no objects, but rather a constant, dizzying play of swift impressions.",LB,dummy
"I imagined a world without memory, without time; I toyed with the possibility of a language that had no nouns, a language of impersonal verbs or indeclinable adjectives.",LB,dummy
"In these reflections many days went by, and with the days, years.",LB,dummy
"Until one morning, something very much like joy occurred—the sky rained slow, strong rain.",LB,dummy
"Nights in the desert can be frigid, but that night had been like a cauldron.",LB,dummy
"The night was waning; under the yellow clouds, the tribe, as joyously as I, was offering itself up to the vivid torrents in a kind of ecstasy—they reminded me of Corybantes possessed by the god.",LB,dummy
"Argos, his eyes fixed on the empyrean, was moaning; streams of water rolled down his face—not just rain, but also (I later learned) tears.",LB,dummy
"Argos, I cried, Argos!",LB,dummy
"Then, with gentle wonder, as though discovering something lost and forgotten for many years, Argos stammered out these words: Argos, Ulysses' dog.",LB,dummy
"And then, without looking at me, This dog lying on the dungheap.",LB,dummy
"Very little, he replied.",LB,dummy
"IV That day, all was revealed to me.",LB,dummy
"The Troglodytes were the Immortals; the stream and its sand-laden waters, the River sought by the rider.",LB,dummy
"As for the City whose renown had spread to the very Ganges, the Immortals had destroyed it almost nine hundred years ago.",LB,dummy
"The founding of this city was the last symbol to which the Immortals had descended; it marks the point at which, esteeming all exertion vain, they resolved to live in thought, in pure speculation.",LB,dummy
"They built that carapace, abandoned it, and went off to make their dwellings in the caves.",LB,dummy
"In their selfabsorption, they scarcely perceived the physical world.",LB,dummy
"He also told me of his own old age and of that late journey he had made—driven, like Ulysses, by the intention to arrive at the nation of men that know not what the sea is, that eat not salted meat, that know not what an oar might be.",LB,dummy
"He lived for a century in the City of the Immortals, and when it was destroyed it was he who counseled that this other one be built.",LB,dummy
"We should not be surprised by that—it is rumored that after singing of the war of Ilion, he sang of the war between the frogs and rats.",LB,dummy
"He was like a god who created first the Cosmos, and then Chaos.",LB,dummy
"There is nothing very remarkable about being immortal; with the exception of mankind, all creatures are immortal, for they know nothing of death.",LB,dummy
"What is divine, terrible, and incomprehensible is to know oneself immortal.",LB,dummy
"I have noticed that in spite of religion, the conviction as to one's own immortality is extraordinarily rare.",LB,dummy
"Jews, Christians, and Muslims all profess belief in immortality, but the veneration paid to the first century of life is proof that they truly believe only in those hundred years, for they destine all the rest, throughout eternity, to rewarding or punishing what one did when alive.",LB,dummy
"In my view, the Wheel conceived by certain religions in Hindustan is much more plausible; on that Wheel, which has neither end nor beginning, each life is the effect of the previous life and engenderer of the next, yet no one life determines the whole....",LB,dummy
"Taught by centuries of living, the republic of immortal men had achieved a perfection of tolerance, almost of disdain.",LB,dummy
"They knew that over an infinitely long  span of time, all things happen to all men.",LB,dummy
"As reward for his past and future virtues, every man merited every kindness—yet also every betrayal, as reward for his past and future iniquities.",LB,dummy
"Much as the way in games of chance, heads and tails tend to even out, so cleverness and dullness cancel and correct each other.",LB,dummy
"The most fleeting thought obeys an invisible plan, and may crown, or inaugurate, a secret design.",LB,dummy
"I know of men who have done evil in order that good may come of it in future centuries, or may already have come of it in centuries past.... Viewed in that way, all our acts are just, though also unimportant.",LB,dummy
"Homer composed the Odyssey; given infinite time, with infinite circumstances and changes, it is impossible that the Odyssey should not be composed at least once.",LB,dummy
"Like Cornelius Agrippa,I am god, hero, philosopher, demon, and world— which is a long-winded way of saying that Aim not.",LB,dummy
"In the first place, it made them immune to pity.",LB,dummy
"I have mentioned the ancient quarries that dotted the countryside on the far bank of the stream; a man fell into the deepest of those pits; he could not be hurt, could not die, and yet he burned with thirst; seventy years passed before he was thrown a rope.",LB,dummy
"His body was a submissive domestic animal; all the charity it required each month was a few hours' sleep, a little water, and a scrap of meat.",LB,dummy
"There is no more complex pleasure than thought, and it was to thought that we delivered ourselves over.",LB,dummy
"From time to time, some extraordinary stimulus might bring us back to the physical world—for example, on that dawn, the ancient elemental pleasure of the rain.",LB,dummy
"Among the corollaries to the doctrine that there is no thing that is not counterbalanced by another, there is one that has little theoretical importance but that caused us, at the beginning or end of the tenth century, to scatter over the face of the earth.",LB,dummy
"Among the Immortals, on the other hand, every act (every thought) is the echo of others that preceded it in the past, with no visible beginning, and the faithful presage of others that will repeat it in the future, advertiginem.",LB,dummy
"Nothing can occur but once, nothing is preciously in peril of being lost.",LB,dummy
"The elegiac, the somber, the ceremonial are not modes the Immortals hold in reverence.",LB,dummy
"I wandered through new realms, new empires.",LB,dummy
"In the autumn of 1066 I fought at Stamford Bridge, though I no longer recall whether I stood in the ranks of Harold, soon to meet his fate, or in the ranks of that ill-fated Harald Hardrada who conquered only six feet or a little more of English soil.",LB,dummy
"In the seventh century of the Hegira, on the outskirts of Bulaq, I transcribed with deliberate calligraphy, in a language I have forgotten, in an alphabet I know not, the seven voyages of Sindbad and the story of the City of Brass.",LB,dummy

"In 1638 I was in Kolzsvar, and later in Leipzig.",LB,dummy
"In Aberdeen, in 1714, I subscribed to the six volumes of Pope's Iliad; I know I often perused them with delight.",LB,dummy
"In 1729 or thereabouts, I discussed the origin of that poem with a professor of rhetoric whose name, I believe, was Giambattista; his arguments struck me as irrefutable.",LB,dummy
"On October 4,1921, the Patna, which was taking me to Bombay, ran aground in a harbor on the Eritrean coast.1 1Part of the ms. is scratched out just here; the name of the port may have been erased.",LB,dummy
"I disembarked; there came to my mind other mornings, long in the past, when I had also looked out over the Red Sea—when I was a Roman tribune, and fever and magic and inactivity consumed the soldiers.",LB,dummy
"Outside the city I saw a spring; impelled by habit, I tasted its clear water.",LB,dummy
"As I scaled the steep bank beside it, a thorny tree scratched the back of my hand.",LB,dummy

"... A year has passed, and I reread these pages.",LB,dummy
"I can attest that they do not stray beyond the bounds of truth, although in the first chapters, and even in certain paragraphs of others, I believe I detect a certain falseness.",LB,dummy
"That is due, perhaps, to an over-employment of circumstantial details, a way of writing that I learned from poets; it is a procedure that infects everything with falseness, since there may be a wealth of details in the event, yet not in memory....",LB,dummy
"I believe, nonetheless, that I have discovered a more private and inward reason.",LB,dummy
"In the first chapter, the horseman wishes to know the name of the river that runs beside the walls of Thebes; Flaminius Rufus, who had bestowed upon the city the epithet ""hundred-gated,"" tells him that the river is the ""Egypt""; neither of those statements belongs to him, but rather to Homer, who in the Iliad expressly mentions ""Thebes Hekatompylos"" and who in the Odyssey, through the mouths of Proteus and Ulysses, invariably calls the Nile the ""Egypt.""",LB,dummy
"In the second chapter, when the Roman drinks the immortal water he speaks a few words in Greek.",LB,dummy
"Later, in the dizzying palace, he speaks of ""a reproof that was almost remorse""; those words, too, belong to Homer, who had foreseen such a horror.",LB,dummy
"Such anomalies disturbed me; others, of an aesthetic nature, allowed me to discover the truth.",LB,dummy
"The clues of this latter type may be found in the last chapter, which says that I fought at Stamford Bridge, that in Bulaq I transcribed the voyages of Sindbad the Sailor, and that in Aberdeen I subscribed to Pope's English Iliad.",LB,dummy
"The text says, inter alia: ""In Bikanir I have taught astrology, as I have in Bohemia.""",LB,dummy
"The first seems to befit a man of war, but then one sees that the narrator pays little attention to the war, much more to the fate of the men.",LB,dummy
"It is odd that Homer, in the thirteenth century, should have copied down the adventures of Sindbad—another Ulysses—and again after many hundreds of years have discovered forms like those of his own Iliad in a northern kingdom and a barbaric tongue.",LB,dummy
"As for the sentence that contains the name ""Bikanir,"" one can see that it has been composed by a man of letters desirous (like the author of the catalog of ships) of wielding splendid words.2 2 Ernesto Sabato suggests that the ""Giambattista"" who discussed the origins of the Iliad with the rare book dealer Cartaphilus is Giambattista Vico, the Italian who defended the  argument that Homer is a symbolic character, like Pluto or Achilles.",LB,dummy

"""At dawn,"" said this poet, ""I awoke speaking words that at first I did not understand.",LB,dummy

"""The sin the two of us now share,"" mused the king.",LB,dummy
"""The sin of having known Beauty, which is a gift forbidden mankind.",LB,dummy
"I gave you a mirror and a golden mask; here is the third gift, which shall be the last.""",LB,dummy
"Of the poet, we know that he killed himself when he left the palace; of the king, that he is a beggar who wanders the roads of Ireland, which once was his kingdom, and that he has never spoken the poem again.",LB,dummy
"That same sweltering morning that Beatriz Viter bodied, after an imperious confrontation with her illness in which she had never for an instant stooped to either sentimentality or fear, I noticed that a new advertisement for some cigarettes or other (blondes, I believe they were) had been posted on the iron billboards of the Plaza Constitución; the fact deeply grieved me, for I realized that the vast unceasing universe was already growing away from her, and that this change was but the first in an infinite series.",LB,dummy
"The universe may change, but I shall not, thought I with melancholy vanity.",LB,dummy
"I knew that more than once my futile devotion had exasperated her; now that she was dead, I could consecrate myself to her memory— without hope, but also without humiliation.",LB,dummy
"I reflected that April 30 was her birthday; stopping by her house on Calle Garay that day to pay my respects to her father and her first cousin Carlos Argentino Daneri was an irreproachable, perhaps essential act of courtesy.",LB,dummy
"Once again I would wait in the halflight of the little parlor crowded with furniture and draperies and bric-a-brac, once again I would study the details of the many photographs and portraits of her: Beatriz Viterbo, in profile, in color; Beatriz in a mask at the Carnival of 1921; Beatriz' first communion; Beatriz on the day of her wedding to Roberto Alessandri; Beatriz shortly after the divorce, lunching at the Jockey Club; Beatriz in Quilines* with Delia San Marco Porcel and Carlos Argentino; Beatriz with the Pekinese that had been a gift from Villegas Haedo; Beatriz in full-front and in three-quarters view, smiling, her hand on her chin....",LB,dummy
"I would not be obliged,  as I had been on occasions before, to justify my presence with modest offerings of books—books whose pages I learned at last to cut, so as not to find, months later, that they were still intact.",LB,dummy
"Beatriz Viter bodied in 1929; since then, I have not allowed an April 30 to pass without returning to her house.",LB,dummy
"That first time, I arrived at seven-fifteen and stayed for about twentyfive minutes; each year I would turn up a little later and stay a little longer; in 1933, a downpour came to my aid; they were forced to ask me to dinner.",LB,dummy
"Naturally, I did not let that fine precedent go to waste; in 1934 I turned up a few minutes after eight with a lovely confection from Santa Fe; it was perfectly natural that I should stay for dinner.",LB,dummy
"Beatriz was tall, fragile, very slightly stooped; in her walk, there was (if I may be pardoned the oxymoron) something of a graceful clumsiness, a soupçon of hesitancy, or of palsy; Carlos Argentinois a pink, substantial, gray-haired  man of refined features.",LB,dummy
"He holds some sort of subordinate position in an illegible library in the outskirts toward the south of the city; he is authoritarian, though also ineffectual; until very recently he took advantage of nights and holidays to remain at home.",LB,dummy
"At two generations' remove, the Italians and the liberal Italian gesticulation still survive in him.",LB,dummy
"His mental activity is constant, passionate, versatile, and utterly insignificant.",LB,dummy
"He has (as Beatriz did) large, beautiful, slender hands.",LB,dummy
"For some months he labored under an obsession for Paul Fort, less for Fort's ballads than the idea of a glory that could never be tarnished.",LB,dummy
"On April 30, 1941, I took the liberty of enriching my sweet offering with a bottle of domestic brandy.",LB,dummy
"Carlos Argentino tasted it, pronounced it ""interesting,"" and, after a few snifters, launched  into an apologia for modern man.",LB,dummy
"""I picture him,"" he said with an animation that was rather unaccountable, ""in his study, as though in the watchtower of a great city, surrounded by telephones, telegraphs, phonographs, the latest in radio-telephone and motion-picture and magic-lantern equipment, and glossaries and calendars and timetables and bulletins...."" He observed that for a man so equipped, the act of traveling was supererogatory; this twentieth century of ours had upended the fable of Muhammad and the mountain—mountains nowadays did in fact come to the modern Muhammad.",LB,dummy
"So witless did these ideas strike me as being, so sweeping and pompous the way they were expressed, that I associated them immediately with literature.",LB,dummy
"Why, I asked him, didn't he write these ideas down?",LB,dummy
"Predictably, he replied that he already had; they, and others no less novel, figured large in the Augural Canto, Prologurial Canto, or simply Prologue-Canto, of a poem on which he had been working, with no deafening hurly-burly and sans reclame, for many years, leaning always on those twin staffs Work and Solitude.",LB,dummy
"First he would open the floodgates of the imagination, then repair to the polishing wheel.",LB,dummy
"The poem was entitled The Earth; it centered on a description of our own terraqueous orb and was graced, of course, with picturesque digression and elegant apostrophe.",LB,dummy
"I begged him to read me a passage, even if only a brief one.",LB,dummy
"He opened a desk drawer, took out a tall stack of tablet paper stamped with the letter-head of the Juan Crisóstomo Lafinur Library,* and read, with ringing selfsatisfaction: I have seen, as did the Greek, man's cities and his fame, The works, the days of various light, the hunger; I prettify no fact, I falsify no name, For the voyage I narrate is ... autour de ma chambre.",LB,dummy
"""A stanza interesting from every point of view,"" he said.",LB,dummy
"""The first line wins the kudos of the learned, the academician, the Hellenist— though perhaps not that of those would-be  scholars that make up such a substantial portion of popular opinion.",LB,dummy
"The second moves from Homer to Hesiod (implicit homage, at the very threshold of the dazzling new edifice, to the father of didactic poetry), not without revitalizing a technique whose lineage may be traced to Scripture—that is, enumeration, congeries, or conglobation.",LB,dummy
"the purified and fanatical cult of form?— consists of twinned hemistichs; the fourth, unabashedly bilingual, assures me the unconditional support of every spirit able to feel the ample attractions of playfulness.",LB,dummy
"I shall say nothing of the unusual rhyme, nor of the erudition that allows me— without pedantry or boorishness!—to include within the space of four lines three erudite allusions spanning thirty centuries of dense literature: first the Odyssey, second the Works and Days, and third that immortal bagatelle that regales us with the diversions of the Savoyard's plume— Once again, I show my awareness that truly modern art demands the balm of laughter, of scherzo.",LB,dummy
"Carlos Argentino read me many another stanza, all of which earned the same profuse praise and comment from him.",LB,dummy
"Application, resignation, and chance had conspired in their composition; the virtues that Daneri attributed to them were afterthoughts.",LB,dummy
"I realized that the poet's work had lain not in the poetry but in the invention of reasons for accounting the poetry admirable; naturally, that later work modified the poem for Daneri, but not for anyone else.",LB,dummy
"His oral expression was extravagant; his metrical clumsiness prevented him, except on a very few occasions, from transmitting that extravagance to the poem.1 [ 1Only once in my lifetime have I had occasion to examine the fifteen thousand dodecasyllables of the Polyalbion —that topographical epic in which Michael Drayton recorded the fauna, flora, hydrography, orography, military and monastic history of England—but I am certain that Drayton's massive yet limited oeuvre is less tedious than the vast enterprise conceived and given birth by Carlos Argentino.]",LB,dummy
"He proposed to versify the entire planet; by 1941 he had already dispatched several hectares of the state of Queensland, more than a kilometer of the course of the Ob, a gasworks north of Veracruz, the leading commercial establishments in the parish of Concepción, Mariana Cambaceres de Alvear's villa on Calle Once de Setiembre in Belgrano, and a Turkish bath not far from the famed Brighton Aquarium.",LB,dummy
"He read me certain laborious passages from the Australian region of his poem; his long, formless alexandrines lacked the relative agitation of the prologue.",LB,dummy
"I do, however, recall these lines from a satire in which he lashed out vehemently against bad poets: This one fits the poem with a coat of mail Of erudition; that one, with gala pomps and circumstance.",LB,dummy
"Both flail their absurd pennons to no avail, Neglecting, poor wretches, the factor sublime—its LOVELINESS!",LB,dummy
"It was only out of concern that he might create an army of implacable and powerful enemies, he told me, that he did not fearlessly publish the poem.",LB,dummy
"he exclaimed in exultation, ""snatched from the jaws of disaster, I can hear you mutter, by success!",LB,dummy
"I admit it, I admit it.",LB,dummy
"One, the epithet routine, while making an adjective of a synonym for 'highway,' nods, en passant, to the inevitable tedium inherent to those chores of a pastoral and rustic nature that neither georgics nor our own belaureled Don Segundo ever dared acknowledge in such a forthright way, with no beating about the bush.",LB,dummy
"And the second, delicately referring to the first, the force-fully prosaic phrase Yawns a bored skeleton, which the finicky will want to excommunicate without benefit of clergy but that the critic of more manly tastes will embrace as he does his very life.",LB,dummy
"The entire line, in fact, is a good 24 karats.",LB,dummy
"The second half-line sets up the most animated sort of conversation with the reader; it anticipates his lively curiosity, puts a question in his mouth, and then ... voilà, answers it... on the instant.",LB,dummy
"The picturesque neologism just hints at the sky, which is such an important feature of the Australian landscape.",LB,dummy
"With-out that allusion, the hues of the sketch would be altogether too gloomy, and the reader would be compelled to close the book, his soul deeply wounded by a black and incurable melancholy.""",LB,dummy
"About midnight, I took my leave.",LB,dummy
"Two Sundays later, Daneri telephoned me for what I believe was the first time in his or my life.",LB,dummy
"He suggested that we meet at four, ""to imbibe the milk of the gods together in the nearby salon-bar that my estimable land-lords, Messrs. Zunino and Zungri, have had the rare commercial foresight to open on the corner.",LB,dummy
"I agreed, with more resignation than enthusiasm, to meet him.",LB,dummy
"It was hard for us to find a table; the relentlessly modern ""salon-bar"" was only slightly less horrendous than I had expected; at neighboring tables, the excited clientele discussed the sums invested by Zunino and Zungri without a second's haggling.",LB,dummy
"Verbal ostentation was the perverse principle that had guided his revisions: where he had formerly written ""blue"" he now had ""azure,"" ""cerulean,"" and even ""bluish.""",LB,dummy
"The word ""milky"" was not sufficiently hideous for him; in his impetuous description of a place where wool was washed, he had replaced it with ""lactine,"" ""lactescent,"" ""lactoreous,"" ""lacteal.""",LB,dummy
"He railed bitterly against his critics; then, in a  more benign tone, he compared them to those persons ""who possess neither precious metals nor even the steam presses, laminators, and sulfuric acids needed for minting treasures, but who can point out to others the precise location of a treasure.""",LB,dummy
"Then he was off on another tack, inveighing against the obsession for forewords, what he called ""prologomania, "" an attitude that ""had already been spoofed in the elegant preface to the Quixote by the Prince of Wits himself.""",LB,dummy
"He would, however, admit that an attention-getting recommendation might be a good idea at the portals of his new work—""an accolade penned by a writer of stature, of real import.""",LB,dummy
"Carlos Argentino remarked, with grudging admiration, that he believed he did not go too far in saying that the prestige achieved in every sphere by the man of letters Alvaro Melián Lafinur was ""solid,"" and that if I could be persuaded to persuade him, Alvaro ""might be enchanted to write the called-for foreword.""",LB,dummy
"In order to forestall the most unpardonable failure on my part, I was to speak on behalf of the poem's two incontrovertible virtues: its formal perfection and its scientific rigor—""because that broad garden of rhetorical devices, figures, charms, and graces will not tolerate a single detail that does not accord with its severe truthfulness.""",LB,dummy
"I agreed, I agreed most profusely.",LB,dummy
"I did, however, for the sake of added plausibility, make it clear that I wouldn't be speaking with Alvaro on Monday but rather on Thursday, at the little supper that crowned each meeting of the Writers Circle.",LB,dummy
"(There are no such suppers, although it is quite true that the meetings are held on Thursday, a fact that Carlos Argentino might verify in the newspapers and that lent a certain credence to my contention.)",LB,dummy
"I told him (half-prophetically, half-farsightedly) that before broaching the subject of the prologue, I  would describe the curious design of the poem.",LB,dummy
"We said our good-byes; as I turned down Calle Bernardo de Irigoyen, I contemplated as impartially as I could the futures that were left to me: (a) speak with Alvaro and tell him that that first cousin of Beatriz' (the explanatory circumlocution would allow me to speak her name) had written a poem that seemed to draw out to infinity the possibilities of cacophony and chaos; (b) not speak with Alvaro.",LB,dummy
"Knowing myself pretty well, I foresaw that my indolence would opt for (b).",LB,dummy
"From early Friday morning on, the telephone was a constant source of anxiety.",LB,dummy
"Fortunately, nothing came of it—save the inevitable irritation inspired by a man who had charged me with a delicate mission and then forgotten all about me.",LB,dummy
"Eventually the telephone lost its terrors, but  in late October Carlos Argentino did call me.",LB,dummy
"Dejectedly and angrily he stammered out that that now unstoppable pair Zunino and Zungri, under the pretext of expanding their already enormous ""café"" were going to tear down his house.",LB,dummy
"he repeated, perhaps drowning his grief in the melodiousness of the phrase.",LB,dummy
"After forty, every change becomes a hateful symbol of time's passing; in addition, this was a house that I saw as alluding infinitely to Beatriz.",LB,dummy
"He said that if Zunino and Zungri persisted in their absurd plans, then Zunni, his attorney, would sue them ipso facto for damages, and force them to part with a good hundred thousand for his trouble.",LB,dummy
"Zunni's name impressed me; his law firm, on the corner of Caseros and Tacuari, is one of proverbial sobriety.",LB,dummy
"Daneri said he'd be speaking with him that afternoon; then he hesitated, and in that flat, impersonal voice we drop into when we wish to confide something very private, he said he had to have the house so he could finish the poem—because in one corner of the cellar there was an Aleph.",LB,dummy
"""It's right under the dining room, in the cellar,"" he explained.",LB,dummy
"In his distress, his words fairly tumbled out.",LB,dummy
"“It's mine, it's mine; I discovered it in my childhood, before I ever attended school.",LB,dummy
"The cellar stairway is steep, and my aunt and uncle had forbidden me to go down it, but somebody said you could go around the world with that thing down there in the basement.",LB,dummy
"The person, whoever it was, was referring, I later learned, to a steamer trunk, but I thought there was some magical contraption down there.",LB,dummy
"I tried to sneak down the stairs, fell head over heels, and when I opened my eyes, I saw the Aleph.""",LB,dummy
"""Yes, the place where, without admixture or confusion, all the places of the world, seen from every angle, coexist.",LB,dummy
"I revealed my discovery to no one, but I did return.",LB,dummy
"Zunino and Zungri shall never take it from me—never, never!",LB,dummy

"If all the places of the world are within the Aleph, there too will be all stars, all lamps, all sources of light.""",LB,dummy
"Sometimes learning a fact is enough to make an entire series of corroborating details, previously unrecognized, fall into place; I was amazed that I hadn't realized until that moment that Carlos Argentino was a madman.",LB,dummy
"All the Viterbos, in fact—Beatriz (I myself have said this many times) was a woman, a girl of implacable clear-sightedness, but there were things about her—oversights, distractions, moments of contempt, downright cruelty—that perhaps could have done with a pathological explanation.",LB,dummy
"Carlos Argentine's madness filled me with malign happiness; deep down, we had always detested one another.",LB,dummy
"On Calle Garay, the maid asked me to be so kind as to wait—Sr.",LB,dummy
"Daneri was in the cellar, as he always was, developing photographs.",LB,dummy
"Beside the flowerless vase atop the useless piano smiled the great faded photograph of Beatriz, not so much anachronistic as outside time.",LB,dummy
"""Beatriz, Beatriz Elena, Beatriz Elena Viterbo,"" I said.",LB,dummy
"""Beloved Beatriz, Beatriz lost forever—it's me, it's me, Borges.""",LB,dummy

"I descended quickly, sick of his vapid chatter.",LB,dummy
"The cellar, barely wider than the stairway, was more like a well or cistern.",LB,dummy
"Carlos picked up one of the bags, folded it, and laid it out very precisely.",LB,dummy
"""The couch is a humble one,"" he explained, ""but if I raise it one inch higher, you'll not see a thing, and you'll be cast down and dejected.",LB,dummy
