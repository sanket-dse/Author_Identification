"My mamma was a nurse with the gentry, and had every comfort, and as I was of her flesh and blood, I lived with her in the master's house.",AC,dummy
"She petted and spoiled me, and did her best to take me out of my humble class and make a gentleman of me.",AC,dummy
"I slept in a bed, every day I ate a real dinner, I wore breeches and shoes like a gentleman's child.",AC,dummy
"What my mamma ate I was fed on, too; they gave her stuffs as a present, and she dressed me up in them.... We lived well!",AC,dummy
"Mamma taught me to read and write, she instilled the fear of God in me from my earliest years, and she so trained me that now I can't bring myself to utter an unrefined peasant word.",AC,dummy

"Maybe I am only a peasant by class, but in nature a noble gentleman.""",AC,dummy
"The ""noble gentleman"" uttered all this in a soft, sugary tenor, wrinkling up his narrow forehead and emitting creaking sounds from his red, frozen little nose.",AC,dummy

"I was young then, and did not understand it all... now I remember that our master had taken another mistress and mamma was greatly disturbed.",AC,dummy

"When we were running away the other convicts would sleep in the forest; I could not sleep, but I was off to the river.",AC,dummy
"The rivers there are wide and rapid, the banks are steep—awfully!",AC,dummy
"The peasants called up a picture of a free life such as they had never lived; whether they vaguely recalled the images of stories heard long ago or whether notions of a free life had been handed down to them with their flesh and blood from far-off free ancestors, God knows!",AC,dummy

"The tramp turned slowly toward Nikandr, and the blissful smile vanished from his face.",AC,dummy
"He looked with a scared and guilty air at the peasant's staid face, apparently remembered something, and bent his head.",AC,dummy

"You'll die, brother!""",AC,dummy
"The man who had forgotten his name looked at the stern, unconcerned faces of his sinister companions, and without taking off his cap, hurriedly crossed himself, staring with wide-open eyes....",AC,dummy

"He wasn't in his own home, of course.",IA,dummy
"The call was a hoarse, urgent whisper, and the youngster bounded to the open window.",IA,dummy
"Slim wasn't his real name, but the new friend he had met the day before had needed only one look at his slight figure to say, ""You're Slim.""",IA,dummy
"He added, ""I'm Red.""",IA,dummy
"Red wasn't his real name, either, but its appropriateness was obvious.",IA,dummy
"They were friends instantly with the quick unquestioning friendship of young ones not yet quite in adolescence, before even the first stains of adulthood began to make their appearance.",IA,dummy
"Slim cried, ""Hi, Red!""",IA,dummy
"and waved cheerfully, still blinking the sleep out of himself.",IA,dummy
"Red kept to his croaking whisper, ""Quiet!",IA,dummy
"Slim noticed all at once that the sun scarcely topped the low hills in the east, that the shadows were long and soft, and that the grass was wet.",IA,dummy
"Slim said, more softly, ""What's the matter?""",IA,dummy
"Slim dressed quickly, gladly confining his morning wash to the momentary sprinkle of a little lukewarm water.",IA,dummy
"He let the air dry the exposed portions of his body as he ran out, while bare skin grew wet against the dewy grass.",IA,dummy
"Red said, ""You've got to be quiet.",IA,dummy

"I heard it, and then I went to the window and it wasn't raining.",IA,dummy
"Slim had never seen it so, but he nodded.",IA,dummy
"""So I just thought I'd go out,"" said Red.",IA,dummy
"Red said, ""Can you keep a secret?""",IA,dummy
"""Sure, Red.",IA,dummy
"Red broke a long, supple stem from a fern they passed, methodically stripped it of its leaflets and swung what was left whip-fashion.",IA,dummy
"For a moment, he was on a wild charger, which reared and champed under his iron control.",IA,dummy
"Then he got tired, tossed the whip aside and stowed the charger away in a corner of his imagination for future use.",IA,dummy
"He said, ""There'll be a circus around.""",IA,dummy
"Slim said, ""That's no secret.",IA,dummy
"""Oh, sure.",IA,dummy
"""Say, there isn't anything I like better.""",IA,dummy
"I mean, for good?""",IA,dummy
"Slim considered, ""I guess not.",IA,dummy
"Slim felt the doors of the new, private world closing on him and astronomy became a thing of dead stars and black, empty space.",IA,dummy

"""No, I'm not.",IA,dummy
"Red whirled at him, strange and intense.",IA,dummy
"Slim stepped back a bit, surprised by the unexpected challenge.",IA,dummy
"Otherwise—Well, I guess I can do it on my own.",IA,dummy
"The world was strange and glamorous, and Slim said, ""Sure thing, Red.",IA,dummy
"What is it, huh, Red?",IA,dummy
"Finally, he said, ""Acrobats?""",IA,dummy
"""Animals, that's what!",IA,dummy
"Anyway, I found animals this morning.",IA,dummy
"Red said, ""We used to have some bird there or something.",IA,dummy
"Anyway, they can't get away from there.",IA,dummy
"Come on, let's go up to the loft.""",IA,dummy
"Slim pointed and said, ""There's sort of a hole in the canvas.""",IA,dummy
"He lifted the canvas, looked in, and said, with relief, ""They're still there.""",IA,dummy
"""The canvas appeared to be burned,"" worried Slim.",IA,dummy
"""You want to look, or don't you?""",IA,dummy
"He wasn't sure he wanted to, after all.",IA,dummy

"""Well, I've got to keep them till the circus comes, don't I?",IA,dummy
"The cage swung and the little trapped creatures clung to its bars, gesturing at the youngsters with queer, quick motions—almost as though they were intelligent.",IA,dummy
"He said, ""Where are the youngsters?",IA,dummy

"At least, in a sense.",IA,dummy
"How, I wonder.""",IA,dummy
"I asked them and, of course, they were vague.",IA,dummy

"""Perhaps,"" said the Industrialist.",IA,dummy
"""It is only in old age that change is unwelcome,"" said the Astronomer, ""and races can be old as well as individuals.""",IA,dummy

"""Why, yes.",IA,dummy
"Oh, I see, you are joking.",IA,dummy
"It becomes too troublesome for the planet to support even the industries that still exist, though they are toothpicks to the oak trees of Beforethewars.",IA,dummy
"Rather the whole effect of change, of a broadening of horizons.",IA,dummy
"Look, sir, I chose you to approach in this matter not only because you were rich and influential with government officials, but because you had an unusual reputation, for these days, of daring to break with tradition.",IA,dummy
"Our people will resist change and you would know how to handle them, how to see to it that—that—""  ""That the youth of the race is revived?""",IA,dummy
"The sinister apartment on Aráoz, however, was too much to bear; on June 6, Teodelina Villar committed the breach of decorum of dying in the middle of Barrio Sur.",LB,dummy
"Shall I confess that moved by the sincerest of Argentine passions— snobbery—I was in love with her, and that her death actually brought tears to my eyes?",LB,dummy
"At some point on the confused night of June 6, Teodelina Villar magically became what she had been twenty years before; her features recovered the authority that arrogance, money, youth, the awareness of being the crème de la crème, restrictions, a lack of imagination, and stolidity can give.",LB,dummy
"My thoughts were more or less these: No version of that face that had so disturbed me shall ever be as memorable as this one; really, since it could almost be the first, it ought to be the last.",LB,dummy
"I left her lying stiff among the flowers, her contempt for the world growing every moment more perfect in death.",LB,dummy
"It was about two o'clock, I would guess, when I stepped into the street.",LB,dummy
"Outside, the predictable ranks of one- and two-story houses had taken on that abstract air they often have at night, when they are simplified by darkness and silence.",LB,dummy
"Drunk with an almost impersonal pity, I wandered through the streets.",LB,dummy
"In that establishment, to my misfortune, three men were playing truco* In the rhetorical figure known as oxymoron, the adjective applied to a noun seems to contradict that noun.",LB,dummy
"Thus, gnostics spoke of a ""dark light"" and alchemists, of a ""black sun.""",LB,dummy
"I asked the owner for a brandy and orange juice; among my change I was given the Zahir; I looked at it for an instant, then walked outside into the street, perhaps with the beginnings of a fever.",LB,dummy
"I thought of Charon's obolus; the alms that Belisarius went about begging for; Judas' thirty pieces of silver; the drachmas of the courtesan La'is; the ancient coin proffered by one of the Ephesian sleepers; the bright coins of the wizard in the 1001 Nights, which turned into disks of paper; Isaac Laquedem's inexhaustible denarius; the sixty thousand coins, one for every line of an epic, which Firdusi returned to a king because they were silver and not gold; the gold doubloon nailed by Ahab to the mast; Leopold Bloom's unreturning florin; the gold louis that betrayed the fleeing Louis XVI near Varennes.",LB,dummy
"As though in a dream, the thought that in any coin one may read those famous connotations seemed to me of vast, inexplicable importance.",LB,dummy
"I wandered, with increasingly rapid steps, through the deserted streets and plazas.",LB,dummy
"My eyes came to rest on a woebegone wrought-iron fence; behind it, I saw the black-and-white tiles of the porch of La Concepción.",LB,dummy
"Possessed, without a trace of sleepiness, almost happy, I reflected that there is nothing less material than money,  since any coin (a twenty-centavo piece, for instance) is, in all truth, a panoply of possible futures.",LB,dummy
"Money is abstract, I said over and over, money is future time.",LB,dummy
"It can be an evening just outside the city, or a Brahms melody, or maps, or chess, or coffee, or the words of Epictetus, which teach contempt of gold; it is a Proteus more changeable than the Proteus of the isle of Pharos.",LB,dummy
"It is unforeseeable time, Bergsonian time, not the hard, solid time of Islam or the Porch.",LB,dummy
"Adherents of determinism deny that there is any event in the world that is possible, i.e., that might occur; a coin symbolizes our free will.",LB,dummy
"After long and pertinacious musings, I at last fell asleep, but I dreamed that I was a pile of coins guarded by a gryphon.",LB,dummy
"I looked at it— there was nothing particularly distinctive about  it, except those scratches.",LB,dummy
"Burying it in the garden or hiding it in a corner of the library would have been the best thing to do, but I wanted to escape its orbit altogether, and so preferred to ""lose"" it.",LB,dummy
"On an impulse, I got off at Urquiza; I walked toward the west and south; I turned left and right, with studied randomness, at several corners, and on a street that looked to me like all the others I went into the first tavern I came to, ordered a brandy, and paid with the Zahir.",LB,dummy
"I half closed my eyes, even behind the dark lenses of my spectacles, and managed not to see the numbers on the houses or the name of the street.",LB,dummy
"That night, I took a sleeping draft and slept soundly.",LB,dummy
"The tale contains two or three enigmatic circumlocutions— sword-water instead of blood, for example, and dragon's-bed for gold —and is written in the first person.",LB,dummy
"Because of the simplicity and innocence of his life, he is judged by some to be an angel; that is a charitable sort of exaggeration, because no one is free of sin—he himself (to take the example nearest at hand) has cut his father's throat, though it is true that his father was a famous wizard who had used his magic to usurp an infinite treasure to himself.",LB,dummy
"Soon, perhaps too soon, that watchfulness will come to an end: the stars have told him that the sword that will sever it forever has already been forged.",LB,dummy
"In an increasingly tortured style, the narrator praises the lustrousness and flexibility of his body; one paragraph offhandedly mentions ""scales""; another says that the treasure he watches over is of red rings and gleaming gold.",LB,dummy
"At the end, we realize that the ascetic is the serpent Fafnir and the treasure on which the creature lies coiled is the gold of the Nibelungen.",LB,dummy
"I have said that composing that piece of trivial nonsense (in the course of which I interpolated, with pseudo-erudition, a line or two from the Fafnismal) enabled me to put the coin out of my mind.",LB,dummy
"The truth is, I abused those moments; starting to recall turned out to be much easier than stopping.",LB,dummy
"It was futile to tell myself that that abominable nickel disk was no different from the infinite other identical, inoffensive disks that pass from hand to hand every day.",LB,dummy
"Moved by that reflection, I attempted to think about another coin, but I couldn't.",LB,dummy
"On July 16, I acquired a pound sterling; I didn't look at it all that day, but that night (and others) I placed it under a magnifying glass and studied it in the light of a powerful electric lamp.",LB,dummy
"In August, I decided to consult a psychiatrist.",LB,dummy
"I did not confide the entire absurd story to him; I told him I was tormented by insomnia and that often I could not free my mind of the image of an object, any random object—a coin, say... A short time later, in a bookshop on Calle Sarmiento, I exhumed a copy of Julius Barlach's Urkunden zur Geschichte der Zahirsage(Breslau,1899).",LB,dummy
"The introduction said that the author proposed to ""gather into a single manageable octavo volume every existing document that bears upon the superstition of the Zahir, including four articles held in the Habicht archives and the original manuscript of Philip Meadows Taylor's report on the subject.""",LB,dummy
"Belief in the Zahir is of Islamic ancestry, and dates, apparently, to sometime in the eighteenth century.",LB,dummy
"In Arabic, ""zahir"" means visible, manifest, evident; in that sense, it is one of the ninety-nine names of God; in Muslim countries, the masses use the word for ""beings or things which have the terrible power to be unforgettable, and whose image eventually drives people mad.""",LB,dummy
"Its first undisputed witness was the Persian polymath and dervish Lutf Ali Azur; in the corroborative pages of the biographical encyclopedia titled Temple of Fire, Ali Azur relates that in a certain school in Shiraz there was a copper astrolabe ""constructed in such a way that any man that looked upon it but once could think of nothing else, so that the king commanded that it be thrown into the deepest depths of the sea, in order that men might not forget the universe.""",LB,dummy
"In 1832, on the outskirts of Bhuj, Taylor heard the following uncommon expression used  to signify madness or saintliness: ""Verily he has looked upon the tiger.""",LB,dummy
"He was told that the reference was to a magic tiger that was the perdition of all who saw it, even from a great distance, for never afterward could a person stop thinking about it.",LB,dummy
"Someone mentioned that one of those stricken people had fled to Mysore, where he had painted the image of the tiger in a palace.",LB,dummy
"Years later, Taylor visited the prisons of that district; in the jail at Nighur, the governor showed him a cell whose floor, walls, and vaulted ceiling were covered by a drawing (in barbaric colors that time, before obliterating, had refined) of an infinite tiger.",LB,dummy
"It was a tiger composed of many tigers, in the most dizzying of ways; it was crisscrossed with tigers, striped with tigers, and contained seas and Himalayas and armies that resembled other tigers.",LB,dummy
"Taylor told this story to Muhammad al-Yemeni, of Fort William; al-Yemeni said that there was no creature in the world that did not tend toward becoming a Zaheer,1 [lThis is Taylor's spelling of the word.]",LB,dummy
"but that the All-Merciful does not allow two things to be a Zaheer at the same time, since a single one is capable of entrancing multitudes.",LB,dummy
"He said that there is always a Zahir—in the Age of Ignorance it was the idol called Yahuk, and then a prophet from Khorasan who wore a veil spangled with precious stones or a mask of gold.2 [2 Barlach observes that Yahuk figures in the Qur'an (71:23) and that the prophet is al-Moqanna (the Veiled Prophet) and that no one, with the exception of the surprising correspondent Philip Meadows Taylor, has ever linked those two figures to the Zahir.]",LB,dummy
"How easy it is not to think of a tiger!, I recall thinking.",LB,dummy
