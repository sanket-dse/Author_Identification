
And besides—it pained
her to compete with mere insubstantial girls.
The sinister apartment on Aráoz, however, was
too much to bear; on June 6, Teodelina Villar
committed the breach of decorum of dying in
the middle of Barrio Sur. Shall I confess that
moved by the sincerest of Argentine passions—
snobbery—I was in love with her, and that her
death actually brought tears to my eyes?
 At some point on the confused night of
June 6, Teodelina Villar magically became what
she had been twenty years before; her features
recovered the authority that arrogance, money,
youth, the awareness of being the crème de la
crème, restrictions, a lack of imagination, and
stolidity can give. My thoughts were more or
less these: No version of that face that had so
disturbed me shall ever be as memorable as this
one; really, since it could almost be the first, it
ought to be the last. I left her lying stiff among
the flowers, her contempt for the world growing
every moment more perfect in death. It was
about two o'clock, I would guess, when I
stepped into the street. Outside, the predictable
ranks of one- and two-story houses had taken
on that abstract air they often have at night,
when they are simplified by darkness and
silence.
Drunk with an almost impersonal pity, I
wandered through the streets. On the corner of
Chile and Tacuari* I spotted an open bar-andgeneral-store. In that establishment, to my
misfortune, three men were playing truco*
In the rhetorical figure known as oxymoron,
the adjective applied to a noun seems to
contradict that noun. Thus, gnostics spoke of a
"dark light" and alchemists, of a "black sun."
Departing from my last visit to Teodelina Villar
and drinking a glass of harsh brandy in a corner
bar-and-grocery-store was a kind of oxymoron:
the very vulgarity and facileness of it were what
tempted me. (The fact that men were playing
cards in the place in-creased the contrast.) I
asked the owner for a brandy and orange juice;
among my change I was given the Zahir; I
looked at it for an instant, then walked outside
into the street, perhaps with the beginnings of a
fever. The thought struck me that there is no
coin that is not the symbol of all the coins that
shine endlessly down throughout history and
fable. I thought of Charon's obolus; the alms
that Belisarius went about begging for; Judas'
thirty pieces of silver; the drachmas of the
courtesan La'is; the ancient coin proffered by
one of the Ephesian sleepers; the bright coins of
the wizard in the 1001 Nights, which turned
into disks of paper; Isaac Laquedem's
inexhaustible denarius; the sixty thousand
coins, one for every line of an epic, which
Firdusi returned to a king because they were
silver and not gold; the gold doubloon nailed by
Ahab to the mast; Leopold Bloom's unreturning
florin; the gold louis that betrayed the fleeing
Louis XVI near Varennes. As though in a
dream, the thought that in any coin one may
read those famous connotations seemed to me
of vast, inexplicable importance. I wandered,
with increasingly rapid steps, through the
deserted streets and plazas. Weariness halted
me at a corner. My eyes came to rest on a woebegone wrought-iron fence; behind it, I saw the
black-and-white tiles of the porch of La
Concepción.*I had wandered in a circle; I was
just one block from the corner where I'd been
given the Zahir.
I turned the corner; the chamfered curb in
darkness* at the far end of the street showed
me that the establishment had closed. On
Belgrano I took a cab. Possessed, without a
trace of sleepiness, almost happy, I reflected
that there is nothing less material than money, 
since any coin (a twenty-centavo piece, for
instance) is, in all truth, a panoply of possible
futures. Money is abstract, I said over and
over, money is future time. It can be an
evening just outside the city, or a Brahms
melody, or maps, or chess, or coffee, or the
words of Epictetus, which teach contempt of
gold; it is a Proteus more changeable than the
Proteus of the isle of Pharos. It is unforeseeable
time, Bergsonian time, not the hard, solid time
of Islam or the Porch. Adherents of
determinism deny that there is any event in the
world that is possible, i.e., that might occur; a
coin symbolizes our free will. (I had no
suspicion at the time that these "thoughts" were
an artifice against the Zahir and a first
manifestation of its demonic influence.) After
long and pertinacious musings, I at last fell
asleep, but I dreamed that I was a pile of coins
guarded by a gryphon.
The next day I decided I'd been drunk. I also
decided to free myself of the coin that was
affecting me so distressingly. I looked at it—
there was nothing particularly distinctive about 
it, except those scratches.
Burying it in the garden or hiding it in a
corner of the library would have been the best
thing to do, but I wanted to escape its orbit
altogether, and so preferred to "lose" it. I went
neither to the Basilica del Pilar that morning
nor to the cemetery*; I took a subway to
Constitución and from Constitución to San
Juan and Boedo. On an impulse, I got off at
Urquiza; I walked toward the west and south; I
turned left and right, with studied randomness,
at several corners, and on a street that looked to
me like all the others I went into the first tavern
I came to, ordered a brandy, and paid with the
Zahir. I half closed my eyes, even behind the
dark lenses of my spectacles, and managed not
to see the numbers on the houses or the name
of the street. That night, I took a sleeping draft
and slept soundly.
Until the end of June I distracted myself by
composing a tale of fantasy. The tale contains
two or three enigmatic circumlocutions—
sword-water instead of blood, for example,
and dragon's-bed for gold —and is written in
the first person. The narrator is an ascetic who
has renounced all commerce with mankind and
lives on a kind of moor. (The name of the place
is Gnita-heidr.) Because of the simplicity and
innocence of his life, he is judged by some to be
an angel; that is a charitable sort of
exaggeration, because no one is free of sin—he
himself (to take the example nearest at hand)
has cut his father's throat, though it is true that
his father was a famous wizard who had used
his magic to usurp an infinite treasure to
himself. Protecting this treasure from
cankerous human greed is the mission to which
the narrator has devoted his life; day and night
he stands guard over it. Soon, perhaps too soon,
that watchfulness will come to an end: the stars
have told him that the sword that will sever it
forever has already been forged. (The name of
the sword is Gram.) In an increasingly tortured
style, the narrator praises the lustrousness and
flexibility of his body; one paragraph
offhandedly mentions "scales"; another says
that the treasure he watches over is of red rings
and gleaming gold. At the end, we realize that
the ascetic is the serpent Fafnir and the treasure
on which the creature lies coiled is the gold of
the Nibelungen. The appearance of Sigurd
abruptly ends the story.
I have said that composing that piece of
trivial nonsense (in the course of which I
interpolated, with pseudo-erudition, a line or
two from the Fafnismal) enabled me to put the
coin out of my mind. There were nights when I
was so certain I'd be able to forget it that I
would willfully remember it. The truth is, I
abused those moments; starting to recall turned
out to be much easier than stopping. It was
futile to tell myself that that abominable nickel
disk was no different from the infinite other
identical, inoffensive disks that pass from hand
to hand every day. Moved by that reflection, I
attempted to think about another coin, but I
couldn't. I also recall another (frustrated)
experiment that I performed with Chilean fiveand ten-centavo pieces and a Uruguayan twocentavo piece. On July 16, I acquired a pound
sterling; I didn't look at it all that day, but that
night (and others) I placed it under a
magnifying glass and studied it in the light of a
powerful electric lamp. Then I made a rubbing
of it. The rays of light and the dragon and St.
George availed me naught; I could not rid
myself of my idée fixe.
In August, I decided to consult a psychiatrist.
I did not confide the entire absurd story to him;
I told him I was tormented by insomnia and
that often I could not free my mind of the image
of an object, any random object—a coin, say... A
short time later, in a bookshop on Calle
Sarmiento, I exhumed a copy of Julius Barlach's
Urkunden zur Geschichte der
Zahirsage(Breslau,1899).
Between the covers of that book was a
description of my illness. The introduction said
that the author proposed to "gather into a single
manageable octavo volume every existing
document that bears upon the superstition of
the Zahir, including four articles held in the
Habicht archives and the original manuscript of
Philip Meadows Taylor's report on the subject."
Belief in the Zahir is of Islamic ancestry, and
dates, apparently, to sometime in the
eighteenth century. (Barlach impugns the
passages that Zotenberg attributes to AbulFeddah.) In Arabic, "zahir" means visible,
manifest, evident; in that sense, it is one of the
ninety-nine names of God; in Muslim countries,
the masses use the word for "beings or things
which have the terrible power to be
unforgettable, and whose image eventually
drives people mad." Its first undisputed witness
was the Persian polymath and dervish Lutf Ali
Azur; in the corroborative pages of the
biographical encyclopedia titled Temple of Fire,
Ali Azur relates that in a certain school in Shiraz
there was a copper astrolabe "constructed in
such a way that any man that looked upon it but
once could think of nothing else, so that the
king commanded that it be thrown into the
deepest depths of the sea, in order that men
might not forget the universe." Meadows
Taylor's account is somewhat more extensive;
the author served the Nazim of Hyderabad and
composed the famous novel Confessions of a
Thug. In 1832, on the outskirts of Bhuj, Taylor
heard the following uncommon expression used 
to signify madness or saintliness: "Verily he has
looked upon the tiger." He was told that the
reference was to a magic tiger that was the
perdition of all who saw it, even from a great
distance, for never afterward could a person
stop thinking about it. Someone mentioned that
one of those stricken people had fled to Mysore,
where he had painted the image of the tiger in a
palace. Years later, Taylor visited the prisons of
that district; in the jail at Nighur, the governor
showed him a cell whose floor, walls, and
vaulted ceiling were covered by a drawing (in
barbaric colors that time, before obliterating,
had refined) of an infinite tiger. It was a tiger
composed of many tigers, in the most dizzying
of ways; it was crisscrossed with tigers, striped
with tigers, and contained seas and Himalayas
and armies that resembled other tigers.
 Taylor told this story to Muhammad al-Yemeni, of Fort
William; al-Yemeni said that there was no
creature in the world that did not tend toward
becoming a Zaheer,1 [lThis is Taylor's spelling
of the word.] but that the All-Merciful does not
allow two things to be a Zaheer at the same
time, since a single one is capable of entrancing
multitudes. He said that there is always a
Zahir—in the Age of Ignorance it was the idol
called Yahuk, and then a prophet from
Khorasan who wore a veil spangled with
precious stones or a mask of gold.2 [2 Barlach
observes that Yahuk figures in the Qur'an
(71:23) and that the prophet is al-Moqanna (the
Veiled Prophet) and that no one, with the
exception of the surprising correspondent
Philip Meadows Taylor, has ever linked those
two figures to the Zahir.] He also noted that
Allah was inscrutable.
Over and over I read Barlach's monograph. I
cannot sort out my emotions; I recall my
desperation when I realized that nothing could
any longer save me; the inward relief of
knowing that I was not to blame for my
misfortune; the envy I felt for those whose
Zahir was not a coin but a slab of marble or a
tiger. How easy it is not to think of a tiger!, I
recall thinking. I also recall the remarkable
uneasiness I felt when I read this paragraph:
"One commentator of the Guishan i Raz states
that 'he who has seen the Zahir soon shall see
the Rose' and quotes a line of poetry
interpolated into Attar's Asrar Ñama('The
Book of Things Unknown'): 'the Zahir is the
shadow of the Rose and the rending of the Veil."
